<p class="pageContent">This website is desiged to look like a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html" target="_blank">terminal window</a>. The idea is based on <a href="https://samphippen.com/" target="_blank">Sam Phippen's</a> work, a fellow Bristol University graduate.</p>
<p>Links are all clickable so navigation should be fairly straight forward. I'll be adding key press functionality so try using 'alt', 'caps locks', 'space', etc., to see what happens.</p>

<p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/samheyman/samheyman.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if want to take a look.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
