This website is desiged to look like a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html" target="_blank">terminal window</a>. The idea is based on <a href="https://samphippen.com/" target="_blank">Sam Phippen's</a> work, a fellow Bristol University graduate.

Links are all clickable so navigation should be fairly straight forward. I'll be adding key press functionality so try using 'alt', 'caps locks', 'space', etc., to see what happens.

Thanks for visiting!
