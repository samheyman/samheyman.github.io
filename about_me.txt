<p class="pageContent"><span class="text">Hi, I'm Sam Heyman.</span></p>
<p>I'm a software engineer currently based in Madrid, Spain. I love working in multi-disciplinary teams, on projects and products that I believe make a difference.
<p>Over the years I have gained a breadth of experience in building     full-stack web applications, integrating 3rd party APIs, software test automation and developer experience, having worked as:
<br>- developer advocate for <a href="http://amadeus.com" target="_blank">Amadeus IT Group</a> (Madrid, Spain) and <a href="http://skyscanner.net" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> (Edinburgh, UK)
<br>- software test engineer for <a href="http://skyscanner.net" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> (Edinburgh, UK)
<br>- avionics systems engineer for <a href="https://www.safran-engineering.com/" target="_blank">Safran Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.airbus.com" target="_blank">Airbus</a> (Toulouse, France)</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano, <a href="./map_box.html">sailing</a>, flying, travelling and, above all, learning new stuff everyday.</p>
